A.
Several relevant websites were analyzed in terms of design and content.
and any suggestions were taken away. These sites are the following:

  * https://www.meinschiff.com/leinen-los/
  * https://www.wolters-rundreisen.de/reisearten.html
  * https://www.checkfelix.com/
  * https://www.tui.at/service-kontakt/onlinekataloge/
  * https://www.its.de/service/online-kataloge.html

The Wolters Rundreisen design in particular was thought of as a basis. The ITS online travel catalog
was also considered for the basic structure of the site.

B.
The README.txt file contains an overview of the project itself. The LICENSE.txt file 
contains the CC BY-SA 4.0 License by Creative Commons downloaded from:

https://creativecommons.org/2014/01/07/plaintext-versions-of-creative-commons-4-0-licenses/

The CHANGELOG.md file should provide information concerning the releases, but in
this case only one draft release will be shown in the file. The rest of the folder
structure is modeled at this structure here:

https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton

C.
The database is to be called 'reisebuero'. The table is to be called 'reisen'. The table contains the following entries:

id (int)                   = automatically incremented integer type
gesamtpreis (decimal)      = total price of the journey
ablughafen (varchar)       = name of departure airport
anreise (varchar)          = date of arrival
abreise (varchar)          = date of departure
Zielort (varchar)          = name of destination
Ãœbernachtungsort (varchar) = name of desstination city
hotelname (varchar)        = name of accomodation

The offers are randomly compiled and do not correspond to actual offers.

D.
The division of the X for the page should look like this. All operations, which have to do
with the database, come into a class. Header, footer come in separate include files. index.php is
the entry point of the program and travels.php is responsible for the display of the database entries.
